Co-operative governance & traditional affairs minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has published new regulations outlining which activities and businesses are allowed under the advanced level 3 lockdown. The amended regulations come after President Cyril Ramaphosa announced earlier this month that more businesses would be allowed to reopen, and some restrictions would be eased. Under the new regulations, restaurants, casinos, cinemas and theatres are allowed only 50 guests, or the number of guests should not exceed “more than 50% of the available floor space”. These facilities can reopen only once safety protocols have been published “by the responsible cabinet minister”. Citizens can now leave their homes to meet three friends and exercise in a group between 6am and 6pm, provided that social distancing is maintained. However, visiting family members in their homes is still prohibited. To date, SA has 138,134 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 2, 456 deaths. These are the changes and what is still banned under advanced level 3 of the lockdown. Changes What remains banned: The latest government gazette can be accessed here.
