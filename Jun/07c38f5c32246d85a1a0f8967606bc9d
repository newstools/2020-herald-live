The global ripple effect of worldwide protest  after the death of George Floyd in the US has reached Port Elizabeth, with residents planning a solidarity picket on Thursday morning. ANC veteran Mike Xego and United Front provincial executive member Lungile Mxube said the South African silence about Floyd’s death “was too loud”. The pair said Floyd’s death at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis  was no different to the brutality many endured during apartheid in SA. “We cannot be quiet while countries   who supported us during apartheid are now also in solidarity with the Americans who demand justice for Floyd, and the end of racism in America,” Xego said. He said even if there was not a large crowd at the Port Elizabeth protest, they aimed to send a powerful message to   South Africans while raising questions about racism in the  US. “What happened to Floyd and how the US president [Donald Trump] has responded to the people demanding justice reminds me of the times of apartheid in this country and because of that we cannot just sit and do nothing,” he said. Mxube echoed Xego, saying Trump’s response in using the military to quell protests was a sign of arrogance towards black people in America. “We want the world to also know that there is a voice from SA  to support the black Americans and the  Floyd family in particular and that we have felt his death and we are suffocating,” he said. The pair said the picket would take place outside The Herald’s building in Greenacres with no permit needed as the protesters would be small in numbers, something the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality confirmed. “The group don’t need to apply and as long as they inform the nearby police station and adhere to social distancing regulations it won’t be a problem,”  municipal spokesperson Mamela Ndamase said.
