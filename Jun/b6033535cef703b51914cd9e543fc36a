Despite being ready to accept pupils on the first day of the reopening of schools on Monday, Khwezi Lomso Comprehensive School opted not to. In a letter circulated to parents on Monday, the Zwide school said it had “received some disturbing news” which forced it to keep its gates closed. EFF MPL Litha Zibula said he went to the school to check on its  readiness for the reopening of classrooms for matrics. According to Zibula he was informed by the principal, Thanduxolo Nqolose, that the school was still closed because a teacher had apparently tested positive for the coronavirus. Zibula shared the  letter from Khwezi Lomso Comprehensive School in which  Nqolose apologised to parents for any confusion caused by the school. The letter said the departments of education and health were working around the clock to deal with the situation. It stated that parents would be notified as soon as pupils could return to school. The department of education has not yet responded to The Herald’s request for comment.
