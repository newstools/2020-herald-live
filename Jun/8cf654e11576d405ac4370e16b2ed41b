Port Elizabeth police are appealing to second-hand dealers and the broader  community to assist in finding a mountain bike valued at R150,000 following an attack on a cyclist at the weekend. The 46-year-old cyclist was allegedly robbed of his bicycle during the early hours of Saturday morning while cycling in Victoria Drive, Walmer, police spokesperson Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said. The incident took place at about 6.10am.
