Health minister Zweli Mkhize said the number of Covid-19 cases had increased to 40,792 on Thursday - an increase of 3,267 cases in 24 hours. "Regrettably, we report 56 more Covid-19 related deaths," he said. These consisted of 54 in the Western Cape and one each in KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State. The combined national death toll now stands at 848 people. "The recoveries to date are 21,311. This translates to a recovery rate of 52.24%," added Mkhize. President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to visit Cape Town on Friday to "assess the Western Capeâ€™s provincial response to the Covid-19 pandemic".
