SA may move to “advanced level 3” lockdown in the next  few days, says minister of small business and development, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni. According to Ntshavheni, the official decision to move the country to “advanced level 3" will be made on “Wednesday at the latest”, as the government is still waiting on the Health Advisory Council to give its  recommendations. Ntshavheni told eNCA that this was not a shift to level 2 but rather  a few changes to  lockdown level 3, and it would be beneficial for small businesses such as hairdressers and restaurants. “When the president announced the movement to level 3, he also announced what he called the advanced level 3, which will include sit-down restaurants and also the opening up of personal care services,” Ntshavheni said. She said her department had already completed the development protocols but that there were still some businesses that were seen as a concern, such as tattoo parlours. The following businesses may be able to reopen under an advanced level 3 lockdown: Ntshavheni told Power 98.7, that the decision to reopen sit-down restaurants was necessitated by a lack of relief funds to support businesses. “The impact on the economy was severe and we went to cabinet after the survey was done and said we don’t have enough relief measures to support small businesses,” she said “We are better off supporting businesses as they come back to the economy because now you are dealing with the viability of businesses.” She said businesses will have to adjust to operating under the “new normal”. “Our argument is that, when you support businesses that are not operating, you are just throwing money away. When you support businesses that are operating you are making them more viable. “You are making them adjust to the new normal because we are going to live with Covid-19 forever so sanitising, social distance, handwashing and all those other things that are protective have to become the norm.”
