A North West school was forced to close after a 56-year old principal  tested positive for Covid-19. The North West education department said the principal reported that he was not feeling well and decided to see a doctor. NW education spokesperson Elias Malindi  said on arrival the doctor suggested a test for Covid-19 since the school principal was showing symptoms of the disease. "The results confirmed the positive status on Tuesday and immediately the principal was subjected to a 14 days self-quarantine," Malindi said. This happened as the schools are preparing for re-opening. Some school principals and school management team had been reporting for work in preparation for the re-opening of schools. North West education MEC, Mmaphefo Matsemela was shocked by the news. "As  the department we are very much shocked to learn about these news. We are working with the department of health who have advised us to close the school with immediate effect. We will rely on their expert advice throughout this period", said Matsemela. Matsemela said the school will not be opened until all necessary investigations have been concluded.
