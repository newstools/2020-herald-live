The correctional services department has recorded 15 new Covid-19 cases. Spokesperson for the department Singabakho Nxumalo said 10 of the cases emanated from the Eastern Cape, while five were from the Western Cape. Of the 15 who tested positive, 11 were officials and four were inmates, Nxumalo said. The  number of positive cases in SA's correctional facilities is 213, and the number of recoveries is  91. The total breakdown of  cases according to provinces: One official at the head office has tested positive. On Sunday, Nxumalo said measures to contain any further spread of the virus had been put in place. “The DCS wants to assure South Africans that it has already commenced with containment and treatment measures where cases have been registered. We have an effective Covid-19 disaster management response strategy which enables us to prevent the rapid spread of Covid-19, thus making it possible to contain the virus.” Nxumalo said the department offered treatment to those in need and this had resulted in 91 recoveries to date. “There is no need to panic as we remain committed to the task at hand, ensuring the wellbeing of both inmates and officials,” added Nxumalo. The assurance came as President Cyril Ramaphosa announced that about  19,000 “low-risk” prisoners would be considered for parole in a bid to contain the spread of the virus in prison. He said female prisoners with infants, the elderly and sick would be the first to be considered.
