The United Kingdom's death toll from Covid-19 rose on Friday to 27,510, an increase of 739, according to figures that include deaths in hospital and in other settings like nursing homes. The figure, which covers the period up to Thursday afternoon, leaves the United Kingdom as the second-worst hit country in Europe behind Italy. Britain's health minister, Matt Hancock, also announced that Britain had met its goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, saying that 122,347 tests were achieved on Thursday, calling it an “incredible achievement”.
