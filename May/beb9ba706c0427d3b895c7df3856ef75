King William's Town police station was closed on Saturday after a 28-year-old female constable  tested positive for Covid-19. According to a statement released by national police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo the community service centre would operate from the hall, normally used for affidavits, behind the police station. He said that police were waiting for the municipality to provide a community hall and expected something in place Monday. Naidoo said that the station could be reached through  the 10111 emergency police  or by contacting the station commander on 082 446 3915 as the usual numbers were not available. The police station will undergo decontamination and the community will be informed as soon as the station is ready to be operational again, the statement read.
