The case against the three police officers accused of killing Eldorado Park teen Natheniël Julies has been postponed to December 8 for further investigation. The three officers made a brief appearance at the Protea magistrate's court on Friday morning. They are accused of shooting and killing the 16-year-old, who had Down's syndrome, in August. The teenager’s killing sparked violent protests that left several people injured and the suburb was locked down for two days. TimesLIVE
