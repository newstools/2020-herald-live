The South African Post Office is warning customers of a scam in which an e-mail — stating that a package could not be delivered  because of outstanding customs duties — is sent to unsuspecting people to solicit money. South African Post Office spokesperson Johan Kruger said post office officials were receiving enquiries from members of the public who had received the e-mail. He said the e-mail address of the sender  was altered to appear as if it was legitimately sent by the Post Office. “The mail contains a link that leads them to a payment page not operated by the SA Post Office, and refers to a fraudulent tracking number not issued by the Post Office. “The Post Office never charges customs fees or import duties before delivering a parcel. “If there are fees payable, this is done at the time when the item is actually handed over to the customer. “Anyone who receives an e-mail of this nature should delete it immediately and must not respond,” Kruger said.
