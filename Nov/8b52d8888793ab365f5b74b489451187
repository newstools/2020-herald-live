The e-edition is an exact digital replica of the print edition of the Herald or Weekend Post, delivered via a service called PressReader. You can page through the newspaper online, via your internet browser or by using our e-edition app. (Note: some PressReader users may have previously had access to our e-edition via their general bundle packages on that platform. From November 13 2020, our e-editions are only available directly via the steps set out below.) The e-edition is available for subscribers only. View our subscription offers here.
