Irate Walmer township residents  are desperate for the municipality to do something about   ongoing sewage leaks  which  have seeped into their yards and homes. Several families  recently spent almost two weeks with raw sewage flowing through their homes and say they have been battling to get help from the municipality. Thozamile Mlalandle, 58, said that for years  raw sewage had flooded their yards when a nearby pump station was faulty. “The coronavirus won’t kill us, this raw sewage will,” he said. “We live a painful life, every day we hope that our yards won’t flood with raw sewage. “For years we have been faced with this challenge. “Whenever the pump station is faulty, we know we will swim in raw sewage.” “I don’t know who to turn to now. “All I am hoping for is that we will get a permanent solution. “This is not the democracy we voted for. “I don’t know how many times this has happened, and how painful it is for officials to come and take pictures but never respond again to the problem,” he said. Another resident, Kholeka Breakfast, said it was very difficult to handle the situation and the municipality was also not very helpful. Municipal spokesperson Mamela Ndamase acknowledged that the pump station was the issue and that due to load-shedding it  had been a problem. Ndamase said the  power failures were caused by illegal electricity connections. “The city is also challenged by constant vandalism to its infrastructure which sometimes causes power outages that affect the pump stations,” she said. “We have been calling on residents to stop stealing electricity and to report cases and those of infrastructure vandalism. “We do report vandalism and theft cases to the police.” On Sunday, Ndamase said they had  attended to sewage leaks in Uitenhage and New Brighton. “What comes out of sewer lines are generally foreign matter that should not be in sewers and [in some cases] the delays relates to the difficulty of removing these as well.” HeraldLIVE
