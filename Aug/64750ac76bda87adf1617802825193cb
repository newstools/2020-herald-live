IPTS staff are on strike  amid claims they were yet to receive  their salaries and wages for July from the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality. According to Spectrum Alert CEO  Trevor Harper, 25 buses and 100 minibuses from Libongolethu would not  be operating on Monday. He said  the  lockdown regulations had caused a delay on the side of the municipality. The Herald   reported in January that  IPTS workers had gone on strike, with  buses  at a standstill for almost two weeks, as workers refused to work until they were paid their wages. The cause of the late payment at that time was due to the municipality computer system being down in December. The late payment affected about 250 drivers, security, support staff, cleaners who operated the buses and feeder taxis to the system. Municipal spokesperson Mthubanzi Mniki was sent  a media inquiry regarding the strike and  said he would respond. This is a developing story. - HeraldLIVE
