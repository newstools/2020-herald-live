On August 12 2020, a Vietnamese man went to the doctor because he was experiencing pain  and believed something had got  into his nose. When a doctor examined him, he discovered a leech was attached to the man's nasal canal and had damaged several parts of his nasal passages, causing the pain. The man said he had been swimming in a stream and believed that was when the leech entered hisÂ nose. He will need several days of treatment to heal the wound.
