Brace for another day of stage 4 load-shedding. Embattled power utility Eskom on Wednesday night confirmed that the stage 4 rotational power cuts would continue on Thursday from 8am to 10pm due to “continuing severe generation supply constraints”. Stage 4 was originally put in place from 4pm on Wednesday. Eskom said the constrained power supply was due to “multiple unit breakdowns” and extra demand “as a result of the cold weather”. TimesLIVE
