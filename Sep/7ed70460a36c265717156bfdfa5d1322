Armed with nothing but a pen, Nkosinathi Menziwa is on a quest to revitalise his native language and culture through poetry. The 46-year-old from Thembalethu in George has written a book in isiXhosa which has been published by Reach Publishers. Published about two weeks ago, Lolani izikrweqe  (loosely translated as sharpen up your weapons) is a collection of poems  dealing with cultural, social, political and spiritual issues of SA. Menziwa said  the title of the book referred to the  ever-changing society which was  influenced by technology and foreign cultures which  required people to be more educated while also remaining rooted to their culture. “I am not saying people must sharpen their blades but rather their minds by broadening their education and seeking knowledge as much as they can. “We need to start doing things by ourselves and not depend on foreign aid all the time because we end up losing our identity in this process,” Menziwa said. The  poems call for people to not forget their roots and celebrate their culture and identity while respecting the rights of others. Menziwa said  he also wanted  to encourage the younger generation to be proud of their native language and culture. “So that in the near future we will have mathematics and physics textbook   written in isiXhosa which will make this possible for our children to be experts in these fields, something that is currently lacking.” Menziwa said  language was  a unique part of the African culture, connecting  people with their ancestors and land, and making up an essential part of  history.
