Willem Breytenbach, who allegedly sexually abused and raped boys as young as 12 from 1983 to 2019, appeared in the Cape Town regional court on Tuesday. The case was postponed for further particulars of the dockets to be finalised and allow the defence lawyer, JC de Jager, time to consult  Breytenbach. Author Deon Wiggett exposed the former teacher and Media24 executive as an alleged sexual offender in a series of award-winning podcasts last year, produced for News24. Wiggett has accused Breytenbach of raping him when he was a teenager in 1997. His experiences prompted him to track down fellow survivors of the alleged assaults and rapes, systematically investigating Breytenbach’s alleged predatory track record. The accused, nicknamed  “Bullfrog” by Wiggett, is charged with six cases of sexual assault and one of indecent assault. On Tuesday morning Breytenbach, dressed in an ill-fitting black suit and a black mask, waited in an isolated corridor away from Court H for the case to commence. “Sorry, but I cannot comment,” he said when asked about the charges against him. Before the brief appearance, De Jager said: “We received the charge sheet last night but have not received the particulars of all the dockets. We are waiting for the particulars of one docket.” The case was postponed  to November 17. TimesLIVE
