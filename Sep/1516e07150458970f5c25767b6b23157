Today, September 28, is World News Day, supported by more than 100 news organisations around the globe. These include BBC News, CNN, the Financial Times, The New York Times, and of course Arena Holdings, the publisher of The Herald, Weekend Post and HeraldLIVE, TimesLIVE, the Sunday Times, Business Day and several more of SA's foremost news publications. “At a time when journalism has the power to save lives, build trust and inform the public’s understanding of an increasingly complex and uncertain world, World News Day is a powerful reminder that journalism can be a force for good — a message that we intend to celebrate on September 28,” says Alexander Jones, global project coordinator for World News Day. Here at Arena Holdings, we asked our editors - Sthembiso Msomi (Sunday Times), Lukanyo Mnyanda (Business Day), Nwabisa Makunga (Sowetan), Rochelle de Kock (The Herald), Cheri-Ann James (Daily Dispatch) and Max du Preez (Vrye Weekblad) – to talk about truth and journalism in today's SA, and to explain why they remain proud of their profession and the contributions our newspapers have made in this country.
