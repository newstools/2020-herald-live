It’s official. Dr Sibongile Zungu, seconded to the province in July by health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize to assist in the fight against Covid-19, has been unveiled as the new administration boss of the provincial health department, albeit on a short-term basis. Zungu, who currently heads the provincial Covid-19 project management unit, will on October 1 officially take over reins from outgoing superintendent-general (SG) Dr Thobile Mbengashe, who will assume a new role as an advisor to premier Oscar Mabuyane. Zungu’s three-month appointment as acting SG was announced on Tuesday by health MEC Sindiswa Gomba during a media briefing in Bhisho. Gomba said Zungu’s tenure as  acting health boss would come to an end in December. DispatchLIVE
