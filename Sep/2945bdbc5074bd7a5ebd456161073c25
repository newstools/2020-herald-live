The EFF protested outside JA Floral Distributors on Monday morning to show support for the four female staff who were forced to reveal their menstrual status to a manageress last week. Just after 9am, almost a dozen members sang and danced in the road outside the Fairview business, which specialises in artificial flowers and party supplies. A large police contingent was on the scene monitoring the situation. The women — all employees at JA Floral Distributors — say they were asked to show their underwear to a manageress after blood was found in a staff toilet. The manageress has since been fired.
