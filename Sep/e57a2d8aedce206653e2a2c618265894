Mohair worth  R4m was recovered on Monday morning after a truck transporting the mohair was allegedly hijacked on its way to Uitenhage. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the Mercedes-Benz truck laden with 90 bales of mohair had left a Burman Drive, Deal Party, depot when the owner noticed that the tracking activation device had started to scramble. “The owner suspected that something was amiss,” Naidu said. The empty truck had been found abandoned by members of the Port Elizabeth K9 unit in Old Uitenhage Road, Kleinskool, at about 10am, she said. As the owner was on his way to  the Swartkops police station to report the alleged hijacking, he spotted the bales of mohair lying in a field in Soweto-on-Sea. K9 unit members assisted by  Bethelsdorp police  officers and visible policing members went back to Soweto-on-Sea, where the 90 bales of mohair were discovered. No suspects were arrested and the mohair had been handed back to the owner, Naidu said. The police are appealing to anyone who can assist them with  information relating to the whereabouts of the suspects to contact  detective  Willie Mayi on 082-697-5914 or  the nearest police station.
