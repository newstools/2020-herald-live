A Ray Mhlaba Skills Centre graduate is not allowing a lack of opportunities under lockdown to impede his passion for fashion, with the Despatch resident opting to share his talent with the needy by designing and distributing masks and sanitary pads for free. Lwazi Mema, 25, who recently graduated from a  sewing and design skills course at the centre, said  he started designing masks and giving them away to the locals  in  April  when he  would stand at shopping malls handing out masks to people who weren’t wearing or could not afford one. He said to date  he had  donated more than 25 sanitary towels and  300 masks. “I bought the material in March before the lockdown but had nothing to do with it, and then I decided to use it for this good cause,” he said. “I was motivated to start this by my female family relatives, who were having a hard time getting sanitary pads due to funds. So since I knew how to sew I decided to try to design a couple of sanitary pads for them to try out. “I kept on improving from that one and later I recruited two of my friends to also get involved and help me with distribution,” he said. Mema said he  gasve to the  less privileged in places like Soweto-on-Sea, Cleary Park Mall, New Brighton and  Motherwell, to name a few. “Doing this for my community makes me feel better, I sleep better at night knowing that I’ve done my part and I hope to inspire others to get involved in this project and grow the idea,” he said. Mema, who is the founder of the Roody Fashino/96 label, said he was also an avid musician and photographer. “I have been doing music, designing fashion and product photography for some time now, in the last three years,” he said. “I’ve used this as my strength to truly understand what the market and followers of brands actually need.” HeraldLIVE
