Naidu said Kolesky had sent his 1 son to fetch something from his bakkie and while the teenager was outside he was confronted by two unidentified men. “One of them pointed a firearm at him and they escorted him into the house. “As they entered, Kolesky tried to get up from the couch but was allegedly shot twice. “The suspects fled on foot,” Naidu said.
