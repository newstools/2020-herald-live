Free State police  confiscated uncut diamonds and drugs at a suspect’s residence on Monday. Brig Motantsi Makhele of Free State police said members of the Welkom K9 unit were busy with their routine patrols in the CBD when they noticed a suspicious vehicle in Muizen Street. “The vehicle was approached tactically and members conducted a search which led to the confiscation of several pieces of diamonds. “They  took the suspect to his residence, a flat in the Welkom CBD. On arrival, while they continued with the search the following were found inside the garage: 22 chrystal meth tablets, 275 Mandrax tablets and one ziplock [bag of] cocaine,” Makhele said.
