SA has entered the nationwide coronavirus lockdown. The Herald newsroom has committed to bringing you all the important Covid-19 news free of charge on our website during this crisis. The Herald and Weekend Post are still being published as normal, and our reporters and editors continue to cover a range of other news: politics, crime, sport, lifestyle and much more. To help keep you engaged during this time, we have a great offer: subscribe to HeraldLIVE for just R60 for 60 days. That's it. There are no recurring payments and you won't be locked into anything. Here's what you get: The e-editions are exact online replicas of the Herald and Weekend Post print editions, brought to our subscribers via a service called PressReader. Once you have subscribed, you can click here to access the e-editions online. If you have already signed in on the website with your email address and password, you'll be able to click right through to an e-edition, else you will first be prompted to sign in. This offer is only available online for new subscribers. (Current subscribers can email helpdesk@heraldlive.co.zaÂ for directions if they would like to add this package onto their current packages.)
