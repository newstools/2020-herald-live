Municipal spokesperson Mthubanzi Mniki said on Tuesday that water tankers were being deployed to the affected areas. Areas that could experience disruptions include Greenbushes. Colleen Glen, Kuyga, parts of Rowallan  Park, St Albans, Bridgemead, Parsons Vlei, Kabega Park, Westering, Sunridge Park, parts of Cotswold, Malabar, Gelvandale and Lorraine. “The  water main has been isolated and the excavator is moving on-site to expose the pipe,” Mniki said.
