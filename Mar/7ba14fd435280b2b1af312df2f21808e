All academic activities and major events at Nelson Mandela University have been suspended until further notice. However, the university said in a statement on Monday that other university operations would  continue, unless circumstances changed, and that staff were  expected to continue working to avoid disruption to operations. After a meeting of senior management to finalise NMU’s response to  the coronavirus crisis, taking into account various scenarios as well as President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address to the nation on Sunday night, the university said it had taken the following decisions: The university’s vice-chancellor, Professor Sibongile Muthwa, said the wellbeing of students and staff remained its top priority. “As such, since the outbreak was announced, we launched an awareness campaign sharing reliable information about how the virus is spread and tips on how best to protect ourselves and minimise the risks of spreading the virus through posters and internal and online platforms. “While academic activities have been suspended, university operations continue, unless circumstances change. “Staff are expected to continue working to ensure no disruption to university operations,” she said. Muthwa said the university was closely monitoring global and national developments around Covid-19, adding that should the situation change the institution would adjust its plans accordingly.
