After pressure from AfriForum, EFF leader Julius Malema and the party's former spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, appeared in the Randburg magistrate's court on Tuesday  for allegedly assaulting a police officer. AfriForum announced in July 2019 that it would approach the court with a mandamus application to compel the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to come to a decision regarding the prosecution of Malema,  the group said in a statement. Malema and Ndlozi allegedly assaulted the SAPS colonel in April 2018 when he refused  them entrance to the burial site of the late Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Malema said the case against him and Ndlozi was “useless” and a waste of time. At their last court appearance in November, Malema denied he and Ndlozi had assaulted the officer. The case was postponed until June 24.
