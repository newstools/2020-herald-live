Facebook, a 1m radius and the eagerness to stay fit is all one needs to keep  exercising over the lockdown period. Profiles Health Club  owner Helen Mentzel and her 14-year-old daughter Alexia  are launching an online Facebook  club to ensure people remain fit during the 21-day lockdown. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Monday night that SA would be locked down from midnight on Thursday until April 16. Profiles Health Club closed on March 24 in light of the outbreak but Mentzel has vowed to keep her existing clients’ fitness on par. Her online journey starts on Monday at 9am. Her virtually guided classes entail: Monday: Legs Tuesday: Shoulders, triceps and back Wednesday: Back and biceps Thursday: Fitness Friday: Circuit and high intensity Saturday: Body conditioning. To join, one simply  has to “like” the Profiles Health Club Facebook page and then start the 40-minute classes, which require  minimal equipment. “If we do not do these classes, people will lose their fitness levels and I think that at a time like this it’s important that people have things to do to  manage their excess energy,” she said. . “The daily packages that I have created can be used without specialised equipment and at most one would need a skipping rope and dumbbells,” she said. “If you do not have dumbbells to use,  just use a jar of mayonnaise, a water bottle or  tins of food. “People really do not need much to keep fit. I think they just need the motivation and that’s where I come in,” she said. Mentzel said the lockdown situation had given her the motivation to go online. . “Many other trainers have gone on the internet and I think this Covid-19 situation is the push that I needed to go into that direction,” she said.
