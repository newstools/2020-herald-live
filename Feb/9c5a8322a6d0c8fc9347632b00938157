An SAA plane was forced to make  an emergency landing at the Port Elizabeth International Airport shortly after midday on Monday after fumes entered the cabin, affecting two cabin crew members. The plane, which was carrying more than 100 passengers, was flying from Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth. SAA spokesperson Tlali Tali said in statement that during the flight, “a paint smell was reported in the cabin just before the plane was due to land”. “Two cabin crew members were affected by the smell and oxygen was administered. The operating crew requested priority routing and landing. “The aircraft landed safely and had 80% passenger occupancy.” Airports Company SA spokesperson Senzeni Ndebele said a phase two emergency was initiated by the airport. Fire trucks were dispatched to attend to the plane on landing. “The flight landed safely and all on board are safe,” Ndebele said. Ndebele said questions relating to any mechanical fault  on the aircraft would have to be answered by SAA. According to the flight schedule, SA405 left OR Tambo International Airport at 10.50am  and was scheduled to land in Port Elizabeth at 12.25pm.  Tlali said SAA was satisfied that proper procedures were followed under the “unusual” circumstances.  “The airline apologises for any possible distress that the incident may have caused to its passengers,” he said. “A full investigation into the incident is under way and the aircraft is undergoing a thorough inspection overnight.” Civil Aviation Authority  spokesperson Pappie Maja said it was  awaiting details and would respond later. Police spokesperson Priscilla Naidu said the police had been on standby at the airport after being alerted. PLEASE NOTE: This article was updated to include comment from SAA.
