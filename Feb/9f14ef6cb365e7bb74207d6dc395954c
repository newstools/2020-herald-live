Students at Nelson Mandela University  blocked access to the North and South Campus over a myriad of grievances. Students and staff are encouraged to liaise with their lecturers and line managers, respectively, for alternative learning and work arrangements. Monday’s action follows a sit-in by students at the NMU main building last week, where they demanded, among other things, student clearance for registration, the NSFAS funding appeal process to be fast-tracked, debt clearance, and accommodation.. A statement released by the university on Monday read: “The university is trying to ascertain the reasons for the blockade and will communicate updates as and when they arise.”  PLEASE NOTE: An earlier version of this story indicated that Daso students had shut down the campus. All students are involved in the shutdown
