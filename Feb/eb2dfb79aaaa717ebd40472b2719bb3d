The price of your favourite daily read, The Herald, will increase by 35c, from R6.60 to R6.95. This will take effect from March 1. Though we have worked hard to keep the price of the newspaper as low as possible — with the last increase  introduced two years ago — cost pressures have forced us to adjust it. The subscription price will remain unchanged for now.
