Amathole District Municipality spokesperson Nonceba Madikizela-Vuso said a disaster team had been dispatched to assess the extent of the damage. “The overflow caused Alice town to be on a standstill as vehicles could barely manoeuvre from one place to  another while some homes have been damaged,” she said. Madikizela-Vuso said details would be made available as the situation unfolds. This is a developing story.
