The state capture inquiry will on Monday hear Eskom-related evidence from an independent consultant for the power utility, Nicholas Linnell. On Friday the Zondo commission heard how senior ANC MP Cedric Frolick allegedly received a computer, shirts, shoes and a belt as “birthday gifts” from Cheeky Watson, brother of  former Bosasa boss Gavin. Angelo Agrizzi had previously alleged that Frolick was used by Bosasa to facilitate meetings between the company and various politicians and paid R40,000 a month. He claimed at the time that the corrupt relationship with the company dated as far back as 10 years. However, Frolick hit back regarding the allegations, saying he'd had a personal relationship with Cheeky since the 1980s. TimesLIVE
