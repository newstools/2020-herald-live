South Africans have flooded Twitter to wish health minister Zweli Mkhize a speedy recovery after he announced that he and wife May tested positive for Covid-19. The minister said they were tested on Saturday after he experienced mild symptoms. “I was feeling abnormally exhausted and as the day progressed, I started losing appetite. My wife had a cough, was dizzy and extremely exhausted. Given her symptoms, the doctors advised that she must be admitted for observation and rehydration,” said the minister in a statement. Mkhize said they informed their close contacts, which include family members and officials in the health ministry. He said they were self-isolating in their homes. The minister urged South Africans not to “regress”, as the risk of Covid-19 and the second wave still stands. “Whatever we do and wherever we go, we have to keep in mind that there remains a risk of a second wave. The virus only spreads through movement and contact of people. Therefore we must all play our part. We must protect ourselves and those we love,” he said.
