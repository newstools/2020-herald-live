According to Janse van Rensburg, the man sustained multiple injuries and was admitted to hospital. The bicycle  stolen is a high-end Trek road bike, grey in colour. “At this stage it is unclear if anything else was taken during the attack,” Janse van Rensburg said. A case of robbery is  being investigated. Janse van Rensburg said police were urging anyone who was driving along Marine Drive and had witnessed the attack to contact the Walmer police station.
