He tested positive for  Covid-19 on Wednesday but was admitted to St George's Hospital the day before as he was short of breathe. He also complained of a constant headache. Lawyer Danie Gouws, who represent Bobani, said he was sedated and on a ventilator. “I am in constant contact with his wife, Nosakhele, and we strongly believe he will overcome this just like he has overcome so much else,” Gouws said.
