A document circulating calling for patients being admitted to Nelson Mandela Bay’s new state field hospital to bring their medical aid and bank cards is fake, Eastern Cape health department secretary-general Dr Thobile Mbengashe said on Friday. “Thank you for checking. No, it is not from us. “This is a state hospital and there is no condition that patients must pay and therefore that they must bring those documents,” he said. The Rev Dr Elizabeth Mamisa Chabula-Nxiweni Field Hospital was tackled as a joint operation by  the  health department, the Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber, the German government, VWSA and the metro, and opened a fortnight ago. The fake document is headed Province of the Eastern Cape Health, Rev Dr Elizabeth Mamisa Chabula-Nxiweni, “Your bring-along and leave-at-home list” — and the items to bring include “medical aid card, bank card”. The document closes with the name of the acting CEO  of the hospital, but  is not signed or dated.
