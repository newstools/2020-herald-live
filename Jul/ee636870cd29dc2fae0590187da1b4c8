Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said on Sunday he had tested positive for Covid-19, the first member of President Muhammadu Buhari's cabinet to contract the new coronavirus. Onyeama, 64, said in a tweet he had taken a Covid-19 test because of a throat irritation. "Did my fourth Covid-19 test yesterday at the first sign of a throat irritation and unfortunately this time it came back positive," he tweeted. "Heading for isolation in a health facility and praying for the best." Reuters
