Ministers in the justice, crime prevention and security cluster will on Wednesday provide feedback on the updated Covid-19 regulations. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday that as a result of the rapid spread of the coronavirus, the sale of alcohol would be banned. This is in line with government's decision to reinstate stricter lockdown rules. Ramaphosa also said a curfew - allowing people to move only from 4am until 9pm -  would be brought back.
