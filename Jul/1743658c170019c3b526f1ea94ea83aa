The US accused Russia on Thursday of test-firing an anti-satellite weapon in space, warning that the threat against Washington’s systems was “real, serious and increasing”. US Space Command had evidence that Moscow “conducted a non-destructive test of a space-based anti-satellite weapon” on July 15, it said. “Last week’s test is another example that the threats to US and allied space systems are real, serious and increasing,” it said. “Clearly this is unacceptable,” US nuclear disarmament negotiator Marshall Billingslea tweeted, adding that it would be a major issue discussed next week in Vienna, where he is in talks on a successor to the New START treaty. The treaty caps the nuclear warheads of the US and Russia — the two Cold War-era superpowers. On Thursday, President Donald Trump told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin that he hoped to avoid an expensive arms race with Russia and China. The system used to conduct last week’s test is the same one that Space Command raised concerns about earlier in 2020, when it manoeuvred near a US government satellite, Gen Jay Raymond, head of US Space Command, said. “This is further evidence of Russia’s continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin’s published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold US and allied space assets at risk,” Raymond said. It is the latest example of Russian satellites behaving in a manner inconsistent with their stated mission, the Space Command statement added. “This event highlights Russia’s hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control,” Christopher Ford, a US assistant secretary of state for arms control, said. The statement also came as China launched a rover to Mars on Thursday, a journey coinciding with a similar US mission as the powers take their rivalry into deep space. — AFP
