Residents in parts of the Nelson Mandela Bayâ€™s western areas will experience a water shutdown from Thursday morning. Municipal spokesperson Mthubanzi Mniki said the shutdown was to allow for the [new] Makro store to connect into the existing water network. He said he was unable to  say when the work  would be completed, but updates on the progress  would be provided. During the operation, which would start at 8am, maintenance work would also be carried out on the pipeline in the western areas. The affected areas include Rowallan Park below Baywest turn-off, Kabega, Morningside, Hunters, Parsons Ridge, Francis Evatt Park, Westering, Malabar and Cotswold. Water tankers  would be dispatched  to Hunters SuperSPAR, MetLife Mall, Linton Spar and the Malabar Community Hall. The municipality has apologised for the inconvenience.
