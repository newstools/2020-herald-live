A Limpopo MEC has tested positive for Covid-19. Premier Chupu Mathabatha revealed this morning that one of his MECs who tested positive to Covid -19 is in self-isolation and quarantine recently. "I have since instructed the Department of Health under MEC Dr Phophi Ramathuba to do all due diligence in making sure that Department is disinfected and all health protocols are duly followed‚Äù, said Mathabatha.
