SA recorded 12,757 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours â€” overtaking, at least for now, Spain to become the eighth worst-hit nation in terms of caseload. Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said in a statement on Wednesday evening that the national death toll had reached 4,453. The cumulative number of infections in the country now stands at 311,049. According to Worldometer, a website providing Covid-19 stats daily, the latest cumulative number of infections puts SA in eighth place in the global rankings, close to Mexico. The number of people who have recovered in SA is 160,693 which translates to a recovery rate of 51.7%. Gauteng health authorities said on Wednesday that 5,576 people with Covid-19 were being treated in private and public hospitals in the province. This was an increase of 952 people since Monday.
