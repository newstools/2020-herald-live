The plot of the upcoming 17th season of Grey’s Anatomy has been established. The medical drama will touch upon the Covid-19 pandemic, a subject the entire world can relate to. “We’re going to address this pandemic for sure,” executive producer Krista Vernoff said  during a panel hosted by the Television Academy titled Quaranstreaming: Comfort TV That Keeps Us Going, to be shown via the Emmys’ website. This announcement could mark a turnaround for the series, which has lately been suffering from lacklustre storylines and numerous cast departures. Most recently Justin Chambers (who plays Dr Alex Karev), left the series after 15 years, leaving Ellen Pompeo (who plays the show’s titular character, Dr Meredith Grey) as the only remaining member of the original cast. The appearance of Covid-19 in the screenplay, which has already been filmed to a large extent, will bring surgeon Owen Hunt, a former military doctor played by Scottish actor Kevin McKidd, to the forefront. For source material, the screenwriters interviewed real doctors about their experiences related to the pandemic. “Every year, we have doctors come and tell us their stories and usually they’re telling their funniest or craziest stories,”  Vernoff said. “This year, it has felt more like therapy. “They are literally shaking and trying not to cry, they’re pale, and they’re talking about it as war — a war that they were not trained for. “I feel like our show has an opportunity and a responsibility to tell some of those stories.” Shooting of the new season has been postponed due to the ongoing health crisis in the US.
