Hundreds of Alexandra residents gathered outside a primary school on Tuesday morning after they were  apparently promised food parcels. Police spokesperson Capt Kay Makhubela said the large crowd gathered outside Marlboro Gardens Primary. “The councillors in the area were not aware of any food parcels and asked them to move away.” Makhubela said the crowd later dispersed.
