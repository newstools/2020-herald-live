President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Friday visit various Covid-19 facilities in Gauteng. The president will be joined by the province's premier David Makhura and health MEC Bandile Masuku. Gauteng is no longer SA's Covid-19 epicentre, as the latest figures show that  the Western Cape has recorded 1,279 cases and Gauteng 1,252. As testing for the virus is significantly ramped up, it emerged on Thursday that there were 318 cases confirmed since the previous figures were released on Wednesday. This was the highest number of positive infections recorded in a day. SA is fast approaching the 4,000 mark with  infections having increased to 3,953.
