The Covid-19 pandemic will  probably kill at least 300,000 Africans and risks pushing 29m into extreme poverty, the UN Economic Commission for Africa (Uneca) said yesterday, calling for a $100bn (R1.77-trillion) safety net for the continent. Africa’s 54 countries have so far reported fewer than 20,000 confirmed cases of the disease, just a fraction of the more than two million  cases reported globally. But the World Health Organisation warned on Thursday that Africa could see as many as 10m cases in three to six months. “To protect and build towards our shared prosperity at least $100bn is needed to immediately resource a health and social safety net response,” the Uneca report said. Uneca is also backing a call by African finance ministers for an additional $100bn in stimulus, which would include a halt to all external debt service. The agency modelled four scenarios based on the level of preventive measures introduced by African governments. In the total absence of such interventions, the study calculated more than 1.2bn Africans would be infected and 3.3m would die this year. Africa has a total population of about 1.3bn. Most of Africa, however, has already mandated social distancing measures, ranging from curfews and travel guidelines in some countries to full lockdowns in others. Yet even its best-case scenario, where governments introduce intense social distancing once a threshold of 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people per week is reached, Africa would see 122.8m infections, 2.3m hospitalisations and 300,000 deaths. Combating the disease will be complicated by the fact that 36% of Africans have no access to household washing facilities, and the continent counts just 1.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. France, in comparison, has 5.98 beds per 1,000 people. Africa’s young demographic — nearly 60% of the population is below the age of 25 — should help stave off the disease. On the other hand, 56% of the urban population is concentrated in overcrowded slums and many people are also vulnerable due to HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malnutrition. Africa imports 94% of its pharmaceuticals, the report said, noting that at least 71 countries had banned or limited exports of certain supplies deemed essential to fight the disease. “In a best-case scenario ... $44bn (R826bn) would be required for testing, personal protective equipment, and to treat all those requiring hospitalisation,” it stated. However, that is money Africa does not have as the crisis could also shrink the continent’s economy by up to 2.6%. “We estimate that between five million  and 29m people will be pushed below the extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day owing to the impact of Covid-19,” the report said. Nigeria alone will lose between $14bn (R263bn) and $19.2bn (R360bn) in revenues from oil exports this year. And the prices of other African commodities exports have plummeted as well. Lockdowns in Europe and the US also imperil Africa’s $15bn (R281bn) in annual textile and apparel exports as well as tourism, which accounts for 8.5% of Africa’s GDP. — Reuters (
