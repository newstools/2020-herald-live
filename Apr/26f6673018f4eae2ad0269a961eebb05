 Bill Withers, the legendary performer who defined 1970s soul with hits like Ain’t No Sunshine and Lean on Me has died after suffering heart complications, his family said. He was 81 years old. “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father. A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other,” the family said. “In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones,” they said. — AFP
