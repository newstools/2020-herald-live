A man was arrested at a roadblock in Gauteng when he attempted to “smuggle” his girlfriend out of Gauteng, MEC for safety and community Faith Mazibuko said. Mazibuko said the car was stopped and searched at a roadblock on the N12 on Friday. When officers asked the man to open his boot, they found the woman inside, she said. He was travelling without a permit. Mazibuko said the woman was also arrested because “she consented to be smuggled”.
