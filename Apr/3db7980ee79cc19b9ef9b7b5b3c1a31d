The department of water and sanitation has scaled up the delivery of water tanks and water via tanker trucks  to  communities across the Eastern Cape to aid in the fight against the spread of Covid-19. Department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau  said  the project was being rolled out in line with a directive from  water and sanitation minister Lindiwe Sisulu. This, in turn, came in response to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s declaration of a national disaster and the strict measures to be taken to fight the virus including regular washing of hands, he said. “To date, a total of 1,089 water tanks have been dispatched to Sarah Baartman, 978 to OR Tambo district, 803 to Chris Hani district, 629 to Amathole district, 595 to Alfred Nzo district, 271 to Buffalo City metro, 222 to Joe Gqabi district and 108 to Nelson Mandela Bay metro. “This brings to 4,695 the number of  water tanks that have been delivered in the Eastern Cape so far and the work is ongoing.” Ratau said the aim was to address the challenge, particularly in densely populated, drought-stricken and rural areas. “Eastern Cape is one of the most rural provinces with many aged people. “Already 2,739 water tanks have been installed thus far to promote thorough washing of hands as required in the struggle against the virus. “The department urges communities to work with government and protect all water infrastructure to benefit everyone. Furthermore, we appeal to people to use water sparingly,” he said.
