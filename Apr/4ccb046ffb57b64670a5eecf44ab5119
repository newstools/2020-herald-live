Pick n Pay management has moved to dispel claims that its  Bluewater Bay store had been closed as a result of  Covid-19. On Tuesday evening, a staff member of  PR company Corporate Image — which   acts on behalf of Pick n Pay —  said the store had indeed closed its doors following a Covid-19 scare but it had turned out to be unfounded. Corporate Image’s Janine Caradonna said the store had closed for a brief while on Tuesday afternoon. “There was a misunderstanding regarding an employee testing positive and the store manager closed the shop for about 15 minutes while he verified the allegations. “Pick n Pay Bluewater Bay does not have a Covid-19 case and is open for business,” she said. Caradonna was answering questions after a WhatsApp message pertaining to the store did the rounds in Nelson Mandela Bay.
