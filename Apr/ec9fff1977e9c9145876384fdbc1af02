The extraordinary circumstances of the national lockdown did   not mean cases could simply be postponed or removed from the roll of the motion court. That was the word from a Port Elizabeth High Court judge on Tuesday as he was hearing civil cases via video conferencing. During the second such occasion where civil matters were heard using Zoom, judge Glenn Goosen said it was prudent that all parties involved who could make use of technology to deal with civil matters did  so. “I must mention notwithstanding the extraordinary circumstances of the national lockdown matters cannot simply be postponed or removed from the court roll by a letter to a presiding officer when these matters should be heard in an open court,” Goosen said. On Tuesday last week, Goosen piloted the first  Zoom video conferencing for civil matters  in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Yesterday was the second time Goosen made use of Zoom and he dealt with 14 matters on the roll. Of those, Goosen gave two judgments, presided over 10 applications and dealt with two rule nisi matters — which relates to court orders being put in place at a later date unless particular  stipulations were met — and a divorce. In one rule nisi matter, Goosen ordered that the parties not present via video conferencing address a letter to the registrar of the court and explain their non-appearance. He then postponed  the matter to May 5. Goosen had previously said that as far as possible courts needed to continue during the national lockdown. The next video streamed motion court proceedings  are expected to take place on Thursday.
