The family of pensioner Ellen Mbhele, who collapsed and died before collecting her social grant in Pimville, Soweto, on Monday, says it will not be easy to adhere to lockdown rules when burying their loved one. The regulations do not permit gatherings of more than 50 people and prohibit the sale of alcohol. In many townships after funerals mourners observe a practice known as “after tears” to celebrate the life of the deceased. Groups of people usually gather to music while some consume alcohol. Mbhele’s granddaughter Phumzile Kheswa said funeral arrangements were under way and the family was taking precautions. She said they had contacted police, were sourcing an attendance register and had already purchased sanitisers in bulk but were grappling with the limit on  attendance numbers. “We are going to try  to stick to 50 people but it’s going to be hard because we’re black people,” she told the media on Tuesday. Family spokesperson Vusi Meshack Mbongane said the burial would be on Friday. He said while preparations were ongoing the family was still reeling from images and information circulated on social media about Mbhele’s death. “Get your facts straight and verify information immediately before publishing ... these things are hurtful.” Mbongane said Mbhele had lived  alone as her husband was dead. The family blamed no-one for her death. “God allowed her to wake up, bath, drink her high blood pressure pills, take a taxi and get off, cross to the other side and only then she felt tired ... we really think it was time,” he said. Gauteng acting social development MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the family and assured them of government support to ensure  Mbhele had a dignified send-off. He said the department had also offered the family counselling.
