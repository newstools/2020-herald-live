At some point, the government might have to institute a total shutdown to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. This was  said yesterday by Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane, who  was concerned that the relaxation of the lockdown regulations was causing a setback  for efforts to flatten the curve. Mabuyane said the amendment of regulations was not good  and the government was looking at a complete shutdown. “At some point, we will have to stop everything. At this time we have to assume that people have bought their food and other essentials and so towards the end of the 21-day lockdown we’ve got to look at having no movements in the streets, even if we have ghost towns. “Of course, medical services would still be available but everyone else has to stay at home,” Mabuyane said. He said there was exponential growth in the number of cases in the province, which government had anticipated considering the influx of people into the province after the commencement of the nationwide lockdown. Eastern Cape health MEC Sindiswa Gomba confirmed the jump on Thursday morning. The number in the metro increased by 13 from the previously reported cases, with 30 people now confirmed to having tested positive. “We are now looking at Nelson Mandela Bay and the Buffalo City municipality as the epicentres of the virus and that is largely due to these areas being tourist destinations and today (Thursday) we have seen a spike of almost 50% from yesterday,” Mabuyane said. He said the government was following up on those who had attended the funeral of a nurse in KwaDwesi as a number of  those present  had tested positive for Covid-19.
