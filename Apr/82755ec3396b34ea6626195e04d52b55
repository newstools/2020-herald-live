If you’re having withdrawal symptoms caused by the shortage of alcohol due to the booze ban‚ don’t worry — you are not alone. Even our  politicians are struggling to control their thirst. ANC MP Robert Mashego could not  restrain himself on Tuesday and complained that the background view of colleague Enock Mthethwa was making him “thirsty” during a virtual portfolio committee meeting. This was a human settlements‚ water and sanitation committee meeting meant to receive feedback from human settlements minister Lindiwe Sisulu about her department’s interventions during the national lockdown. “No‚ no‚ chairperson‚ member Mthethwa is making us thirsty. We are thirsty and there is the booze‚”  Mashego joked in isiZulu. Mthethwa was readying himself to pose a question to departmental officials during the meeting when his background showed a number of bottles of whisky. He was seemingly unaware of his background display and quickly changed his positioning. But EFF MP Rebecca Mohlala was quick to call Mashego to order over his “thirst”. “Please stop going on about booze. We have not spoken yet and we are waiting to speak and you are busy telling us about booze. You get thirsty [for booze] a lot‚” Mohlala said‚ also speaking in isiZulu. Since the lockdown started‚ MPs have been given the opportunity to do their work from home‚ typically using the Microsoft Teams app. Numerous South Africans have flooded social media over the past three weeks complaining about running out of booze. Some have gone as far as making their own home-brewed beer using pineapples and other ingredients.
