The man suspected of carrying out an attack on police officers in France' central Puy-de-Dome region has been found dead, interior minister Gerald Darmanin said on Twitter on Wednesday. Three police officers were shot dead when a man opened fire on them when they arrived at a house in a remote village in response to a call about domestic violence against a woman, police said.
