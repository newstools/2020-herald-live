Port Elizabeth police have recovered more than 800 stolen vehicles in 2020 through the efforts of the vehicle crime investigation unit. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General  Liziwe Ntshinga praised the unit  for its collaboration with the community and private sector stakeholders in achieving a high arrest and conviction rate since January. “Through their dedication and hard work 38 suspects were arrested, leading to convictions that total a combined 232 years in prison for crimes including hijacking, theft of motor vehicle, possession of a suspected stolen vehicle, robbery and fraud related to vehicles,” police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said. A total of 822 vehicles were recovered, and Naidu said many of these cases  could be linked back to crime syndicates operating across provincial borders. HeraldLIVE
