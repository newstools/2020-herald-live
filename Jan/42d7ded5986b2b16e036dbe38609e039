Two Bay Post Offices were robbed this week,  police to urge Post Offices officials to be  extra vigilant. The latest robbery was on Wednesday afternoon when four gunmen entered the Ring Road Post Office in Greenacres and  ordered clients to lie on the ground. Police spokesperson Capt Sandra Janse Van Rensburg said  the robbery happened at about 2pm. “One suspect jumped over the counter and pointed a firearm at the cashier.” The suspect instructed the cashier to open the safe but  she did not have the key. When the manager returned from her break the suspect forced her to open the safe. “As one suspect was busy removing the money from the safe, the other two  robbed  clients and the fourth suspect stood guard at the door,” Janse van Rensburg  said. The  robbers fled in a silver Mercedes-Benz which was later found abandoned in Adcockvale. Robbers also hit the Post Office in Main Road, Despatch, at about 2.45pm on Tuesday. Uitenhage police spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart one of the  suspects entered the Post Office and inquired  about  vehicle registration papers. “The suspect then exited the building and returned with three other men. “The suspect proceeded to jump over the counter and open the security door for the other suspects. “Two of these suspects were armed. “The suspects threatened the employees and  took an undisclosed amount of cash from a safe and the tills,” Swart  said. “They  then fled from the scene on foot and  local police were notified.” Swart said  the different detective units were working together to determine if the same suspects were involved in  both incidents. “It is being investigated. We are also asking cash businesses to ensure  they keep minimal money on site and that  their banking is done regularly. “Ensure that your cash collection provider is informed of the increase in cash payments  so additional collections can be made,” she said. “If any suspicious activity is noticed, we urge residents to contact the police immediately.”
