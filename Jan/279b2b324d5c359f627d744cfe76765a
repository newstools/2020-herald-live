Queen Elizabeth II will host a showdown meeting with Prince Harry on Monday in an attempt to solve the crisis triggered by his bombshell announcement that he and wife Meghan were stepping back from the royal frontline. Other senior royals including Harry’s father Prince Charles and brother Prince William, with whom he has strained relations, will join the monarch at her private Sandringham estate in eastern England, according to British media. Meghan will join the meeting via conference call from Canada as they attempt to work out the “next steps” towards a compromise. Issues up for debate include how much money the couple will still receive from Charles’s estate, their HRH titles and what commercial deals they can strike, according to the Sunday Times. Harry, Meghan and son Archie spent Christmas in Canada, with the American former actress returning there this week. The Queen on Thursday demanded that staff work with the couple to urgently find a workable solution  that would take into account their demands for more freedom and desire to divide their time between Britain and the US. Harry has been open about his mental health issues and he and Meghan in 2019 admitted to struggling with the spotlight. — AFP
