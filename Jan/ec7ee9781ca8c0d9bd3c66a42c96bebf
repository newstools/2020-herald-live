A teenage boy was found only metres  from his shack in Khozi Street, on the outskirts of Despatch, after being stabbed during the early hours of Wednesday. Brian Witbooi, 17, died on arriving at  hospital after being found by his brother shortly before 1am. Police said  the motive was being investigated, adding that Witbooi did not have his cellphone or wallet on him at the time of the stabbing. Police spokesperson  Captain Gerda Swart said  Witbooi had been stabbed once in the chest and was found lying near  his shack in the Khayamandi informal settlement. “His 19-year-old brother heard someone moaning close to the house and went to investigate. “He found his brother [Witbooi] in the street with a single stab wound to the chest,” she said. “Witbooi was rushed to hospital by private car but died when arriving at the hospital.” Swart said  Witbooi had left the house at 11pm without telling anyone where he was going. “At this stage we are looking at all possibilities, but it appears  his wallet and cellphone were not on him at the time of the incident. “Currently the motive is unknown,” she said.
