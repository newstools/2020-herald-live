The DA has applauded the improved pass rate of the Eastern Cape’s Class of 2019. DA Bhisho MPL  Yusuf Cassim said  it  applauded the hard work, determination and sacrifices made by learners, teachers  and parents who had triumphed through difficult circumstances  such as insufficient and poor access to  infrastructure, sanitation, the internet and scholar transport. “South Africans, and especially the people of the Eastern Cape, persevere in the most trying of circumstances and deliver wonderful achievements, in spite of the challenges they face,” Cassim said. “The DA celebrates these achievements even as our thoughts go out to those who did not pass and others that were excluded along the way by the Eastern Cape education department. We will fight for and stand by these learners who have been robbed of opportunities,” he said. Cassim, however, raised concerns about the low learner retention and high dropout rates in the Eastern Cape. “Schools must not only receive incentives for better matric results, incentives must also be provided for improved learner retention and lower dropout rates, as is done in the Western Cape,” Cassim said. “The DA will work hard to ensure improved higher education and skills development opportunities as well as fight for economic growth and job creation for our youth.” The Eastern Cape received a special mention from education minister Angie Motshekga during the announcement of the national pass rate, for having achieved the biggest improvement among the provinces. The province’s pass rate is 76.5% — up from 70.6% in 2018.
