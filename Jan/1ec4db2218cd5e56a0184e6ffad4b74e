While the festive season draws to an end and the ever-present onslaught of back-to-school advertising bombards parents feeling the financial pinch after splurging their hard-earned money over the past two weeks, Weekend Post conducted a flash price comparison on a number of school supplies to help ease the anxiety. With most retail shops dropping their prices of school stationery staples drastically in the days leading to the start of the first term on January 15, items on the shelves at selected shops may change in the coming days. Major shops visited by Weekend Post this week included Pick n Pay Hypermarket at William Moffett Park, Game at The Bridge, and Shoprite and Checkers at Greenacres. All the shops visited have specials and promotions on various school stationery items, including those listed below. Eight generic items listed on most schools’ stationery supply lists issued to parents were selected. All four retailers showed a high number of parents already shopping for the best prices, with some saying the financial strain of having to buy the necessary supplies was back-breaking.  Carol Visser, 36, of Kabega Park, said buying school supplies for her two primary school  children had become more and more expensive over the past few years. “It is a very expensive time of year. School supplies are becoming more and more expensive and having two kids at school makes it  twice as expensive,” Visser said. Single mum of one Chantel Fourie, 38, of Kensington, said school supplies were becoming too expensive to afford. “As a single parent I have to save money throughout the year not only for Christmas and New Year, but for back-to-school supplies too,” Fourie said. A Motherwell resident and mother of three who only identified herself as Thandeka said it was becoming a financial burden on her to ensure her children had what they needed for school. “It is the school fees, school clothes and the stationery which makes it so expensive,” Thandeka said. While you can expect to pay almost R500 for the items priced, Game shows a marginally cheaper offering with a basket full of basic stationery adding up to R475.99, while the most pricey of the shops is Pick n Pay at R506.92.
