As the bumper festive season  comes to an end, South Africans have started making their way to work  this week. Many, however, seem to be not quite ready, wanting  an extension  to do the pouncing cat (a trendy dance move), rest and spending time with family. Matriculants are also on a knife’s edge awaiting their results, with basic education minister  Angie Motshekga set to  release the national results on Tuesday evening, with the individual results  to be released on Wednesday. Online users took the time to contribute to #MondayMotivation, giving encouragement to  those that are starting off this week.
