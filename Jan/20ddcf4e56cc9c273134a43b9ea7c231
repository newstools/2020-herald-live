Fears rising SowetanLIVE reported that Mashiane’s aunt, Sharon, said the past few days had been daunting for the family as they were worried about her safety. “We are worried about her health, as she was diagnosed with depression in December and placed on medication. She hasn’t taken her medication  since she went missing. “According to her friend, on Saturday evening she went to buy a cigarette and never came back. Her phone has been off since then. "It was only on Monday when the friends decided to call us to ask if she was back at home, because they had not seen her. “We started panicking, went to the police to open a case of a missing person and searched the streets - with no luck,” she said. 'Looking confused' Mashiane's friend on social media said she had been to search for Mashiane in the Braamfontein area after they heard she was spotted there looking “confused”. “My parents and I are on the way to Braam to look around because some street kids say they saw her last night on the streets and said she didn't seem okay mentally." Search party Family, friends, Wits university personnel and the police  organised a search party for the student on Wednesday, and another will take place on Thursday  night. Anyone with information is asked to get in contact with the police directly, or Nino Mashiane.
