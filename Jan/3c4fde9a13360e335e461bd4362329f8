Ever wondered where the municipal  refuse bags being sold at intersections across the metro come from? With a municipal truck driver now a suspect in the theft and reselling of the black bags, the municipality hopes to have the answer soon. The truck driver was identified as a suspect yesterday  after two men were caught in Newton Park allegedly selling municipal refuse bags on the side of the road. The executive director for safety and security, advocate Keith Meyer, said  the municipality had received a tip-off about the sale of municipal refuse bags in Newton Park. “I tasked the safety and security investigators to follow up on the information. “Within an hour, they had caught two people   [allegedly with] 200 municipal refuse bags in their possession,” he said. “The investigation  led [the investigators] to a corner shop in Korsten, where about 3,000 more bags were found.” Meyer said  after viewing nearby CCTV footage, the investigators identified a municipal truck driver from the cleansing department as the man who was allegedly selling the bags. “The driver was located at the municipal depot in Gail Road  and was taken to the Gelvandale police station for alleged theft.” Meyer said  it was illegal to sell  municipal property. “These bags are supplied by the municipality and are not for sale by third-party agents trying to make a few bucks. “We suspect that there is a network selling municipal refuse bags for profit. “Our team, together with the police, is looking into this and more suspects  will be identified soon,” he said. Police spokesperson  Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said   the men allegedly involved in the  theft had not been detained yet because the case was still being investigated. “Police have verified their addresses and  other information. “They are not considered a flight risk. “Once the probe is done, we will take the case to the public prosecutor to make a decision on how to proceed,” she said.
