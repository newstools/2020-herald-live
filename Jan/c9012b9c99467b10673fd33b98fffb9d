Gelvandale police  are investigating a case of murder and attempted murder after a shooting which claimed the life of one man and wounded two others   outside Mercantile Hospital on Friday. Police spokesperson Col Priscilla Naidu said officers had responded to a reported shooting at 2.25pm  on the corner of Durban and Cottrell streets in Korsten. Naidu said  police had found the  body of a 28-year-old man   on the pavement. “Two other males, one a 30-year-old and the other of  unknown age, sustained gunshot wounds. “The 30-year-old was shot in the abdomen and the unidentified  man  had  multiple gunshot wounds,” Naidu said. It is  suspected that the 30-year-old, a trader  who  operates from a container close to the shooting scene, was   hit by a stray bullet. “It is unknown at this stage whether the other victim, who sustained several gunshot wounds, was with the deceased or not. “The next of kin of the deceased  has yet to be notified.” Naidu said the circumstances surrounding the incident had yet to be established,  and the police were investigating a case of murder and two cases of attempted murder.
