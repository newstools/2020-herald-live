Hopes faded yesterday  of finding more survivors from a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey as more bodies were pulled from the rubble and the death toll climbed to 35. Nearly 4,000 rescue workers combed through debris in freezing temperatures, helped by mechanical diggers, in vain hopes of finding anyone alive in the city of Elazig. Three bodies were found in the city centre, 38 hours after the 6.8-magnitude quake struck on Friday evening, bringing the death toll to 35 in Elazig province and nearby Malatya, Vice-President Fuat Oktay said. Interior minister Suleyman Soylu  said workers were searching for six people still under the rubble. Residents nervously waited to find out what happened to their relatives. So far, the authorities say 45 people have been rescued alive but it is believed 14 people are still under the rubble in the region. The government’s disaster and emergency management agency (AFAD) said 1,607 people had been injured including 104 still in hospital. There was growing concern for residents amid the bitter cold,  Hasan Duran, a 58-year-old shopkeeper, who lives in Sursuru, said. “If it was summer, people could maybe resist a little longer. “But with this cold, it’s hard to imagine. Even we are freezing at home. May God give them strength”. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said yesterday  “every effort will be made to ensure citizens whose homes have collapsed or been damaged will not suffer in this winter period”.   The epicentre of the quake was in the small lakeside town of Sivrice in Elazig province, and also affected neighbouring cities and countries. With a population of about  4,000, Sivrice is located south of Elazig city on the shores of Hazar lake — one of the most popular tourist spots in the region. The US Geological Survey said the magnitude was 6.7, slightly lower than AFAD, adding that it had struck near the East Anatolian Fault, in an area that has suffered no documented large ruptures since an earthquake in 1875. There was elation on Saturday when Ayse Yildiz and her two-year-old daughter were found alive by rescuers after 28 and 24 hours respectively. Nearly 80 buildings collapsed while 645 were heavily damaged in Elazig and Malatya provinces, disaster  management officials  said in a statement. Residents avoided returning to their homes because of aftershock fears. They included Mustafa Top who said he would “wait a week while the aftershocks continue and then we’ll check [our apartment].” Since Friday’s quake, there have been 714 aftershocks with 20 above four in magnitude. — AFP
