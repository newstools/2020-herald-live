A 2m black mamba was removed from a chicken coop in Canelands, north of Durban, on Thursday. Security company Reaction Unit SA (Rusa) was called to the residence after the owner saw a snake eating his chickens. “Reaction officers called for the help of a snake catcher, who captured and relocated the snake,” it said in a statement. In a video of the capture, someone can be heard saying the snake had eaten a chicken and a chick. A python was captured at the same residence on Wednesday night. According to Rusa, it was called to 53 snake incidents over the festive season. On Monday, a 2.4m black mamba was removed from a factory in Redcliffe, north of Durban.
